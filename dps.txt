here's nothing intuitive about boiling pasta. Yet many pasta recipes don't offer much beyond "cook pasta according to directions on box." And the box often offers little beyond how many minutes it takes for the pasta to cook. So we're clearing up the mystery right here and now with these four simple steps:

1. Heat a pot of saltwater big enough to accommodate your cooked pasta plus an inch or two of pasta water (for a pound of pasta, you'll want four quarts).

2. When it's boiling (you'll see big bubbles in the water and steam rising from the pot), add your pasta

3. After it comes to a boil again, set a timer to the minutes specified on the pasta box, adjusting the flame downward if it begins boiling over, which sometimes happens.

4. When the timer goes off, drain and rinse the pasta in cool water to stop the cooking process.

All that's left is adding the sauce. Might we recommend this simple one made from garlic and oil ((and from which we adapted our pasta-cooking instructions)?
